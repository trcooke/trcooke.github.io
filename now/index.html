    <h2>What I'm doing now</h2>
    <p>(This is <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">a now page</a>)</p>
    <h3>Staying at home</h3>
    <p>Following the <a href='https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus'>UK Government advice on Coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> I am
         spending a lot more time at home than usual. I live in Bangor (Northern Ireland) with my Wife and 2 year old Son where we are spending a lot of time playing in the garden and trying not to say the work 'Park' too loudly.</p>
    <h3>Working at home</h3>
    <p>I'm the Engineering Lead at <a href="https://www.axial3d.com/" target="_blank">Axial3D</a>.</p>
    <p>We make medical 3D print models for complex surgery planning. You would think we'd be quiet with COVID-19 but we're now also making <a href="https://www.axial3d.com/blog/axial3ds-response-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank">Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and ventilator parts</a> with extra printers borrowed from <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Ulster University</a> and <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/" target="_blank">Farset Labs Belfast</a>.</p>
    <p>Otherwise I spend my days trying to make sense of Amazon AWS stuff and am finding <a href="https://www.serverless.com/" target="_blank">serverless</a> to be a great help with that.</p>
    <h3>CodeRanch</h3>
    <p>As staff at <a href="https://coderanch.com/tim" target="_blank">coderanch.com</a> I help run the <a href="https://coderanch.com/wiki/660305/Book-Promotions-Schedule" target="_blank">weekly Book Promotions</a> and help people solve their programming problems. This month I got <a href="https://coderanch.com/t/729951/promotions" target="_blank">promoted to Marshal</a> for being one of the 5 most active Sheriffs (a Sheriff is a Moderator and Administrator).</p>
    <h3>Building this website</h3>
    <p>I've been putting this website together for years which is quite the challenge for me because I'm terrible at building websites. I can make them technically work and integrate with backend services but the graphic design stuff is not for me.</p>
    <p>Having tried many different techniques and platforms and I've gone back to basic with plain and simple static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That's it, and I kinda like it.</p>
