    <h2>Exercises for Programmers (Python): 1 of 57 - Saying Hello</h2>
    <small>26th July 2020</small>
    <p>I'm really bad at Python and I want to get better, so I've chosen this book by 
        <a href="https://bphogan.com/">Brian P. Hogan</a> as a way to do that. 
    <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/">Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills</a>.</p>
    <blockquote><p>Create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.</p>
        <h4>Example Output</h4>
        <pre>What is your name? Brian
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>From previous tinkerings with Python I know that it's a scripted language as well as Object Oriented, so I'm 
        going to start with a script because that's what I know. I created file 
        <code>hello.py</code> containing the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + ", nice to meet you!")</code></pre>
    <p>And run it with this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-none">$ python3 hello.py
What is your name? Tim
Hello, Tim, nice to meet you!</code></pre>
    <p>Happy days!</p>
    <p>Next up I want to learn how to write and run unit tests. A quick Google for 'python unit testing' 
        informed me of two seemingly popular options, namely <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
        and <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a>. Since unittest is part of the Python library I 
        went with that, figured out the syntax, created file <code>test_hello.py</code>, and wrote the following failing test:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">import unittest
import hello
            
            
class TestHello(unittest.TestCase):
            
def test_givenValidName_returnsExpectedString(self):
self.assertEqual(hello.sayhello('Tim'), 'Hello, Tim, nice to meet you!')</code></pre>
    <p>I've made an assumption with my test here that I will extract the greeting generation code into its own 
        function called <code>sayhello</code> that takes a single 'name' argument, and returns the appropriate string.
        I know the function doesn't exist yet and I expect the test to fail, but let's see what command I need to 
        run the test.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-none">$ python3 -m unittest
What is your name? Tim
Hello, Tim, nice to meet you!
E
======================================================================
ERROR: test_givenValidName_returnsExpectedString (test_hello.TestHello)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/tim/Development/github/57-exercises-python/01-saying-hello/test_hello.py", line 8, in test_givenValidName_returnsExpectedString
    self.assertEqual(hello.sayhello('Tim'), 'Hello, Tim, nice to meet you!')
AttributeError: module 'hello' has no attribute 'sayhello'
        
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s
        
FAILED (errors=1)</code></pre>
    <p>Well that was not what I expected at all. I expected the test to fail but not in this way. What's going on:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The <code>hello.py</code> file is running as a script and prompting me for keyboard input, which is not what 
            I want from automated tests.</li>
        <li>It can't find the <code>sayhello</code> function, which is fair enough because it doesn't exist yet but the 
            error message is rather cryptic with <code>AttributeError: module 'hello' has no attribute 'sayhello'</code>. 
            Perhaps that'll make more sense one day.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let's address problem 1. I want to see if I can stop the unit test running the file as a script. Again with a little searching I have 
        discovered that there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html">Top-level script environment</a>
        which provides the following template to run certain code only when run as a script.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">if __name__ == "__main__":
    # execute only if run as a script</code></pre>
    <p>Now, if I extract the greeting generation into its own function and put the keyboard input and terminal output code
        in the <code>__main__</code> function I have this</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def sayhello(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + ", nice to meet you!"
    
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(sayhello(input("What is your name? ")))</code></pre>
    <p>And passing tests</p>
    <pre><code class="language-none">$ python3 -m unittest
.

OK</code></pre>
        <h3>Learning review</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard intput is requested with <code>input("Prompt text: ")</code>, and terminal output is printed
                with <code>print("Printed text")</code>.</li>
            <li>Python 'modules' are defined by the file name. A file <code>hello.py</code> has module 'hello'. Other 
                files use that module with <code>import hello</code>.</li>
            <li>The built in Python unit test framework is 'unittest'.</li>
            <li>All unittest test cases must <code>import unittest</code> and subclass <code>unittest.TestCase</code>.</li>
            <li>All unittest files must be named with a 'test' prefix, e.g. <code>test_hello.py</code>.</li>
            <li>All unittest test functions must be named with a 'test' prefix also. e.g. <code>test_givenValidName_returnsExpectedString(self)</code></li>
            <li>I think the <code>self</code> argument in the previous point refers to <code>TestCase</code>.</li>
        </ul>
