## Work Experience

### Software Architect: Axial3D, Belfast (2022 - Present)
A deliberate shift from team leadership to technical leadership, facilitated by some strategic delegation of undifferentiated heavy lifting, allows me to focus on enabling our team of excellent engineers including myself to deliver quality software into production. I design systems, I design integrations between systems, I write code, I engage with customers to propose technical solutions. I also play a key technical role in the continued success of their ISO27001:2013 and ISO27001:2022 accreditation.
