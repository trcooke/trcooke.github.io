    <h2>Exercises for Programmers (TypeScript): 1 of 57 - Saying Hello</h2>
    <small>8th November 2020</small>
    <p>My team are working a lot in TypeScript and I know nothing about it, so I've chosen this book by 
        <a href="https://bphogan.com/">Brian P. Hogan</a> as a way to learn. 
    <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/">Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills</a>.</p>
    <blockquote><p>Create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.</p>
        <h4>Example Output</h4>
        <pre>What is your name? Brian
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Oh boy, where do I start? This is TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript, so why not have it run on this
        browser, wouldn't that be fun! I'm going to need some way of getting user input, some way of indicating that 
        I've finished user input, and some way of displaying output. That very much sounds like a form, so I'd better 
        brush off my HTML skills.</p>
        <div id="example">
        <form id="greeting">
            <label for="name">What is your name?</label><input id="name" type="text">
            <input type="submit" value="Go!"></input>
        </form>
        <p>Output: <span id="output"></span></p>
        </div>
        <p>If you've tried out the form already you'll have noticed that I've skipped to the end. Let's recap
            and see how I got there.</p>
        <p>First I had to install the TypeScript compiler</p>
        <pre><code class="language-none"></code>$ sudo npm install -g typescript</pre>
        <p>Handily I already had node installed, but can be gotten from  
            <a href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> if not.</p>
        <p>Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript is a compiled language which really takes a lot of the guesswork out of
            writing JS code since any syntax errors can be identified up front at compile time rather than at run
            time which is typical when working with JS. Even if you simply wrote JavaScript and used the TypeScript
            compiler for syntax validation there's value in that. For this exercise, this is the TypeScript code:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-typescript">const form = document.getElementById("greeting");

form.addEventListener("submit", function ( event ) {
    event.preventDefault();
    var nameInput = document.getElementById("name") as HTMLInputElement
    var person = new Person(nameInput.value);
            
    var outputSpan = document.getElementById("output") as HTMLSpanElement
    outputSpan.innerText = generateGreeting(person)
})
            
function generateGreeting(person: Person) {
    return "Hello, " + person.name + ", nice to meet you!"
}
            
class Person {
    constructor(public name: string) {
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>Which compiles with</p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">$ tsc greeting.ts</code></pre>
        <p>creating file <code>greeting.js</code> that contains</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">var form = document.getElementById("greeting");
form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    var nameInput = document.getElementById("name");
    var person = new Person(nameInput.value);
    var outputSpan = document.getElementById("output");
    outputSpan.innerText = generateGreeting(person);
});
function generateGreeting(person) {
    return "Hello, " + person.name + ", nice to meet you!";
}
var Person = /** @class */ (function () {
    function Person(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    return Person;
}());</code></pre>
        <p>That was pretty interesting being able to use the class construct to create custom types which is familiar 
            to me coming from Java. It was also really useful to be able to cast/coerce the DOM element that would be 
            fairly generic in JS into a <code>HTMLInputElement</code> which then gave my IDE guidance on what functions
            are available for it and compile time validation that those functions are valid. In comparison to vanilla 
            JS that's a big advantage.</p>
        <p>For this example I wrote a single .ts file and compiled it to a .js file and my
            initial research determined that in order to set up unit tests for TypeScript code it would need a bit more
            of a convoluted setup, so I'll keep that in mind for the next example.
        </p>
        <h3>Learning review</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is actually TypeScript. Simply renaming your .js files with .ts extension is valid TypeScript.</li>
            <li>Compiling TypeScript into JavaScript validates syntax.</li>
            <li>You can use the <code>as</code> keyword to cast/coerce variables into a particular Type. e.g. 
                <code>var nameInput = document.getElementById("name") as HTMLInputElement</code>.</li>
        </ul>
