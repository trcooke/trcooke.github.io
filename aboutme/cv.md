## Professional Experience

### Software Architect: Axial3D, Belfast (2022 - Present)
A deliberate shift from team leadership to technical leadership, facilitated by some strategic delegation of undifferentiated heavy lifting, allows me to focus on enabling our team of excellent engineers including myself to deliver quality software into production. I design systems, I design integrations between systems, I write code, I engage with customers to propose technical solutions. I also play a key technical role in the continued success of their ISO27001:2013 and ISO27001:2022 accreditation.

### Head of Engineering: Axial3D, Belfast (2020 - 2022)
A leaving CTO and a joining CPO left a technical leadership sized hole in the organisation that I naturally and gladly filled. I provided overall leadership of the software and ML development teams, I had responsibility for Site Reliability and System Administration functions, responsibility for technical leadership of all software products, supporting development teams in making architecturally significant decisions, all the while continuing to write code and deliver quality software systems into production.

### Software Engineering Lead: Axial3D, Belfast (2019 - 2020)
A significant change coming from a large corporate financial technology company where I had been used to organisational silos built around technology functions. I am now in control of and responsible for every aspect of the system. A double edged sword, I have the freedom to do what I think is right, but also the burden to do what I think is right. I wrote code and developed quality software, improved deployment stability with improved SDLC process, expanded the development team with excellent engineers, and as became an apparent requirement in a rapidly growing start up generally did what needed to be done.

### Senior Software Engineer: CME Group, Belfast (2017 - 2019)
A member of the Trade Execution team working on the financial exchange match engine system, some might say the technical core of the business. If ever evidence was needed that a monolithic Java application can be rock solid reliable and wickedly fast, this is it.

### Software Engineer III: CME Group, Belfast (2014 - 2017)

### Software Engineer II: CME Group, Belfast (2012 - 2014)

### Software Engineer: Mformation, Belfast (2007 - 2012)
A Mobile Device Management (MDM) system for a time before the iPhone was ubiquitous and Nokia was king. A HTML, JavaScript web application backed by a Java server side component.

### Software Engineer: Sony Broadcast & Professional Research Lab, Basingstoke (2007)
Myself and two IPL colleagues were contracted out to Sony for a project working on their Ziris product. A Java and Java Swing application to control media presentation on TV screens. My first experience working within a large team in an Agile fashion. CVS was the source control system in use, and while a step up from rsync much time was spent in conflict resolution.

### Software Engineer: IPL, Bath (2006 - 2007)
My first Software Engineering job after University. The first thing they taught me was how to use Adatest 95, and while the tool is no longer in vogue the principles and values of automated testing were set in me right from the start. There was a couple of Java projects in need of a fresh face so after a crash course in java I was on my first ever real life project and the only thing I remember about it was that our source control was a remote file system and rsync. Thankfully, I never encountered that pattern again.

## Education

### MSc Multimedia Technology: University of Bath (2005 - 2006)
Here is where I was first introduced to Linux, not through the course content but by a classmate who regularly extolled the virtues of Gentoo.

### BSc Electronic Communication Systems: University of Plymouth (1998 - 2002)
